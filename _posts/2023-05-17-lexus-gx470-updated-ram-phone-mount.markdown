I've updated my [old phone mount solution](https://rskelton.com/lexus-gx470-ram-cell-phone-mount/) for the GX470, still utilizing the RAM mount, but now it also uses the blank cover when I removed my air suspension. 

The previous option of having the RAM mount on the A-pillar was OK but blocked some of my vision, I'd rather obscure less of my windshield if possible. 

Parts Used:
* [Toyota Console Box Hole Cover](https://amzn.to/3wTbhJI)
* [1x RAM Ball](https://amzn.to/2QOqKrb)
* [1x M6-1.0x70mm bolts](https://amzn.to/3tGfCvg)
* [1x RAM Composite Double Socket Swivel and Ratchet Arm](https://amzn.to/2RPMOlT)
* [1x RAM X-Grip Phone Holder](https://amzn.to/3dF32a8)
* Random rubber spacer from my toolbox

This involves drilling a hole in the console box cover, running the RAM screw and ball through it and securing it from the bottom. Then just arrange your arm and X-Grip holder as needed.
