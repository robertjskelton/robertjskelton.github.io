The Cappuccino takes [3x NGK DCPR7EIX 6046spark plugs](https://amzn.to/3VBdcNP) - it was cheaper to buy 4 than 3. 
This might be a good time to change your spark plug wires too, the NGK part number for that is RC-SE43. 

To change your spark plugs on the Suzuki Cappuccino, pop your hood.

Remove the cover. I painted mine while it was off.

Remove the spark plug lines, and either remember where they go, or label them, so that the firing order stays correct.

Remove the spark plugs with a [spark plug socket](https://amzn.to/3VOZIPJ).

Re-install the new plugs with the spark plug socket. I found 23Nm as the torque spec, but didn't follow it.

Re-attach the spark plug lines.  You can remove your labels here.
