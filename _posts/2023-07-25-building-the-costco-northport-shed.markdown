My dad and I built the [Costco Nortport](https://www.costco.com/northport-wood-storage-shed---do-it-yourself-assembly.product.4000051398.html) shed over a long weekend, here's how we did it, how much it costs, and some other details. 

Costs
This shed normally costs $2,600 + tax, I got it on sale for $2,000 + tax, plus 5% back on whatever credit card I used, which was 5% back on wholesale clubs. 

I had to build a shed pad, which I did used 2 4x4x12 and 2 4x4x16, to make a 12x16 pad. I then put 2' rebar through the 4x4s every few feet, and then filled the boards with 2 yards of crushed rock. 
Rebar: $100
4x4s: $100
Rocks delivered: $250

I then made a base from 4 more 4x4x8 to fit under the shed, and all of the wood I've mentioned so far has been pressure treated. 
More 4x4s: $100

Since this shed is under 100sqft and built on skids (4x4s) I did not need a permit, but I built this shed even stronger than the manufacturer recommends, because I want it to last a long time. 

BUILD THE SHED
[Shed Instructions](https://content.syndigo.com/asset/914492b1-a5ec-4edf-b7c4-27cd03a2d938/original.pdf)

The shed was delivered where I asked (as close to the site as possible). It came in 2 boxes, the first was for the base, and it was on top, so that was nice. I built the shed base myself, and the instructions say to use the shed base for the rest of the build as your work platform. 

The second box contained the rest of the shed, and it looked very small, but it had all of the parts in it! 

One difficult instruction for us was putting up the triangle eave wall, above the front and rear walls. The instructions aren't very clear, but you are supposed to put the top eave triangle plywood OVER the bottom plywood, as opposed to putting them flush. 

We also had to make a decent amount of cuts around the soffit wood to get everything to fit - the wood for the front overhang wasn't perfectly square, so I think that is what caused it. 

We built this shed in July 2023, and the 4 days we worked were the 4 hottest days on record in the world (so far). We worked early morning til noon or so, took a break for the heat, then worked from dinner til night most days. 

We put up all of the walls in 1 day, which looked like we were almost done, but that's not close to half of it. 

Putting up the rafters/roof was the next day. 

Doing the roof felt and drip edge, and other trim and eaves work was the 3rd day. 

The doors and windows were the 4th and final day with my dad. 

I did the shingles inside workbench, caulk on a few subsequent days.
