Parts:
* [Dome Light x1, 194](https://amzn.to/3W81xpn)
* [Frunk Light: 36mm festoon, thin x2](https://amzn.to/450UJOs)
* [License Plate Lights: 36mm festoon x2](https://amzn.to/450UJOs)

To replace the old bulbs on your Ferrari 360, buy the above parts. 

To replace the license plate bulbs, unscrew the 2 phillips screws on each license plate bulb, then swap the new festoon in, verifying it works before re-installing as the LEDs do have polarity.

For the dome light, use a trim tool to pop the light out, then replace the 194 bulb. This is a weird light, where if you don't buy the correct LED you could be stuck with a light that only comes on when the door is open, and won't turn on when you flip the switch to turn on, see [this write-up on FChat](https://www.ferrarichat.com/forum/threads/diy-360-spider-overhead-light-led-upgrade.444987/).

For the frunk, same thing, just pop the old light out with a trim tool, new festoon in.

There is also a light in the glove box, but my glove box is zip tied shut for now.
