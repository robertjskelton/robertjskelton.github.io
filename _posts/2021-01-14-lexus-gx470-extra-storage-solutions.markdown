The GX has lots of room, and lots of opportunities to better organize your stuff. Some people build drawers in the back or buy fancy [metal molle panels](https://www.ragofabrication.com/products/gx-470-modular-storage-panel-system-powder-coated). I went just a few cheap organizers off of Amazon, plus the [table I built in the back](https://rskelton.com/GX470-Rear-Door-Table/). 

I just bought 2 of [these storage organizers](https://amzn.to/3bETGud), I installed them on both sides of the center console in the front. We use them for storing our face masks, very 2020 appropriate. Once covid is over, not sure what I'll put here. They're held on with 3M tape.

Update: the 3M tape fell off less than a day later! I pre-drilled 4 spots for screws and they aren't going anywhere now.

I also bought a [Molle panel organizer](https://amzn.to/38HDwOM) that I keep on the drivers sunvisor to hold some pens and garage door opener.

I bought [this larger organizer](https://amzn.to/3ic3ptp) that fits perfectly over the rear drivers side panel in the third row using the included velcro straps. It is used for holding more pens, tire pressure gauge, emergency chapstick, flashlight, pocket knife, etc. I also have a great travel dog water bottle that doesn't spill.

And, of course, behind that panel is some more storage. I keep a small air compressor and my tow hitch stuff in here.

My wonderful [table on the rear door](https://rskelton.com/GX470-Rear-Door-Table/)! Behind it, I keep some toilet paper, paper towels, first aid kit, [collapsible dog bowl](https://amzn.to/38OuOyB) (yeah, we travel with our dogs often), and the factory tool set is back there. I even mounted in a [bottle opener](https://amzn.to/35H2dJq).

A few months later, I made some more improvements. I added a [car ceiling storage net](https://amzn.to/3py1LFZ), to get some of the stuff off the third row seats.

I also cut some [foam gym tiles](https://amzn.to/3fWII4X) to have a bit more comfort in the third row area. Our dogs ride back here, and the foam covers up the metal and plastic anchors for the third row seats.

I even added a [rechargeable magnetic light](https://amzn.to/2S8JvHe), which can simply attach to the metal of the rear door to light up the rear table at night. This is a great option for adding light above a table when you don't want to run new wiring through the door grommets, which is a hassle.

All these storage items and the table build cost under $100, so a very cheaper way to optimize your GX's storage.
