I was quoted $1600 to change my broken pool light housing by my local Pinch a Penny, and that didn't even include modifying the conduit or existing wiring. So I decided to tackle it myself, and spent under $350 on the whole project. 

## Parts
* [12V LED Pool Light with Transformer](https://amzn.to/3WQxJ1l) - $290
* [Project Box](https://amzn.to/3MazrFS) - $20
* [Power Tester Pen](https://amzn.to/3ArZeXv) - $15
* [Stainless Steel Pool Screw](https://amzn.to/4dO34IL) - $7
* [Fish Tape](https://amzn.to/3YRCvhI) - $25
* Assorted Conduit and conduit glue

My existing pool light was broken, and it turned out the seal had broken and the inside was rusted out, so I needed an entire new housing. The transformer box was also rusted over, and testing the electrical wiring let me find out that the junction box near my pool was not getting power. So that made me think the existing transformer was burned out, so I bought a new [LED light with its own transformer](https://amzn.to/3WQxJ1l). This can be turned on via switch, which I just leave on, and you can download an app, or use the included remote to turn it on and off and switch colors and settings. I only use the remote.

The wiring was pretty straight forward, and I made sure the part worked before even putting the light in the water, and it wired as I expected.

For saferty, always work with the power off, and verify with a [power tester pen](https://amzn.to/3ArZeXv) if power is on. My pool light was actually on a sub-panel I had never noticed, so it was not turned off by the normal breakers in my electrical panel.  I cut and pulled out the old light, then started rebuilding the junction box by my pool. It was rusted and ruined and didn't even have a cover. This part took me the longest, as I had 1/2" conduit going in to 1" conduit right next to each other. It just took a while to build the correct setup for my conduit at Lowes.

Once I got that junction box fixed up and sealed with conduit glue, I installed the pool light with a new [stainless steel pool screw](https://amzn.to/4dO34IL). I actually used a normal screw until my stainless screws came in, and it rusted within hours.

 I pulled the line for the pool light through with a [fish tape](https://amzn.to/3YRCvhI). Then I pulled that same line to the project box and old transformer area, near my pool pump stuff.

I ended up ripping out my old transormer, but re-used the inground conduit.

I rebuilt the conduit with a new project box and conduit, then fished the pool light wire to that box. This is where I installed the included transformer.

The 4 pool light wires hooked into the right side of the transformer with 4 wires, just wire nut together the like for like wires. The left side wires are a red/green/white, which I ran through conduit to my pool timer box. The wiring for my light was already in this box, so I followed the wires and reused the same wiring from the previous pool light. It is just power/neutral/ground. Wire nut those togehter.

Then I tested by flipping on the breaker and the light switch, and it worked! I made sure to seal everything up well, and added silicone and used waterproof seals everywhere I could. I want this light to last as long as possible!
