Inspired by [this post](http://www.georgiajag.com/Ferrari/Clock/Clock.html), I wanted to having a working clock in my Ferrari 360 Spider. The backlight is awful from the factory, this mod involves removing the old clock light and installing a new LED one

Parts and Tools:
* [Clock Light x1, T5](https://amzn.to/3IjYi8x)
* [plastic trim tool](https://amzn.to/41NBftE)
* 4mm Allen wrench
* Phillips screwdriver

First, remove your dome light, I detailed how to do this in my [last post on replacing all the LEDs](https://rskelton.com/Ferrari-360-LEDs/). 

Behind the dome light, there are 2x 4mm allen screws to remove, then your whole housing can come off.

There are 2 Phillips screws kinda holding on the clock, just back them out a bit. Kinda weird they don't actually screw into or through the clock.

Now that the clock is off, you can remove the light, if your fingers can't reach it then a set of needle nose pliers should work.

Swap the old bulb with your new [T5 LED](https://amzn.to/3IjYi8x), re-install and verify that the light comes on. If it doesn't reverse the polarity of your light. To test, turn the accessory of your 360 on by turning the key 1 click.

To finish the install, screw the 2 Phillips back into the clock, run the dome light wiring through the hole and install the 4mm Allen screws, re-install the dome light.

Total install time: 12 minutes according to my clock

Set your clock using a small device, I used my trim removal tool. The left button sets the hour, the right button sets the minute. Now you have a usable clock!
