This is the story of getting my 2001 Ferrari 360 Spider maintenance done at [Vlad's Autobahn](https://vladsautobahn.com/) in West Melbourne, Florida, owned by Vlad (or Eric) Hamke and the timeline and costs. 
Before dropping off the car, the Ferrari had an oil leak, the convertible top was slow to close, there was a suspension light on, and that it couldn't turn right properly. 

Also put in some info about dealing with State Farm insurance on an agreed value policy. 

### 5/24/2022 - Day 0
Drop car off for work to be done. Was quoted 1 month for car to be picked up and completed. Vlad offers to sell me his Ferrari 360 Modular wheels. I decline. He says they will fix it up real nice, it'll be in perfect shape when it is done, and says he will even roll the fenders on it for free, and says he has some other surprises for me. 

### 5/31/2022 - 7 days after drop off
Bought some new stock Ferrari 360 "starfish" rims to replace the 20" rims that came on my Ferrari. $1,400 with tires, picked up in Orlando.

Receive initial estimate of $27,941.58, [here](/docs/vlad/1.pdf).

Vlad noted every thing wrong with the car mechanically, and I approved all other repairs. 

### 6/11/2022 - 18 days after drop off
Vlad says he found a broken shift fork in the transmission. 

### 6/16/2022 - 23 days after drop off
Dropped of $15,000 for parts to be ordered and work to begin. Picked up the rear challenge grill to clean and repaint it myself. 
Vlad says the new rims need a different size lug bolt, so I order a set shipped to him off of ebay for $150. 

### 6/23/2022 - 30 days after drop off
New lug bolts for the new rims arrive at Vlad's.

Asked Vlad to send me some certain pictures of the car to obtain new insurance through State Farm. 

### 10/24/2022 - 154 days after drop off
Asked for the above pics again, and asked for how progress is going - Vlad says still waiting on parts. He says some of the parts still haven't shipped. 
I asked for the list of parts he is still waiting on to see if I can find them elsewhere. He said that he was told by his supplier that the parts I need should be available by the end of October. I get mad and ask to find parts outside of his usual means. He gets mad and says I can pick up my transmission, which is torn apart on a table, take it to another shop to rebuild, and he will put the rebuilt trans in with no warranty or guarantee on it. I say I don't want to do that, I just want part numbers you need and to see if I can expedite it, as my car has been in the shop for 158 days at this point. 

### 10/26/2022 - 156 days after drop off

### 12/21/2022 - 211 days after drop off
Vlad says the coolant hose has arrived and waiting on a gasket that should arrive today. 

### 12/22/2022 - 212 days after drop off
Vlad sent me a video of the 360 running and said it will be drivable today. 

### 12/28/2022 - 218 days after drop off

### 1/10/2023 - 231 days after drop off
Asked for an update, no response. 

### 1/11/2023 - 232 days after drop off
Received a final bill from Vlad's mom, [here](/docs/vlad/4.pdf). No other communication about any variator issues. Noticed that power steering items and engine mounts were removed from the bill and spark plugs and air filters were added. Number of hours on the transmission had doubled from 10 hours to 20 hours. Timing belt tensioners went from $340 on the estimate to $664 on the bill, and the hours worked on the convertible top went from 6 hours to 8. Also noticed that his hourly rate changed from $180 to $195/hr. 

# 1/12/2023 - 233 days after drop off
Vlad lets me know they sent the bill, that they are short staffed, that parts delays are happening, and he will get me a quote on the variator. 
Called Strictly Foreign, a reputable Ferrari shop in town, and left a voice mail. Stan, the owner of Strictly Foreign, called me back an hour later, said he could diagnose and fix my issue, but it will be a few weeks before they have room to work on my car. His rate is $165/hr.

# 1/18/2023 - 239 days after drop off
Asked State Farm if the Agreed Value has been updated to $100k. They said it has and asked for more pictures of the car. 
Asked Vlad for more pictures of the car. He said he will send them, and that his mom had sent an estimate for the variator fix (she hadn't). He said he wil followup. 
He asked if I could come pay for the rest of what I owe on the car, I asked him to let me know once it's ready and I could come pay for it. 

# 1/24/2023 - 245 days after drop off
I receive an estimate to replace the variator from Vlad. It is a $295 part and 26 hours of labor at his new rate of $195/hr. I inform him that I will be declining this repair and picking up my car next week. He offers to have it detailed. I then asked when I could come pay and pick up and he says next week after he is done racing. 

# 2/2/2023 - 254 days after drop off
Paid off the balance in full, $35,373.22. He had installed air filters I had declined, as the car had new engine air filters, which he threw away, so he gave me the new air filters for free. 

Vlad noted he performed the convertible top work he quoted, but did not fix the sag in the top and informed me that I should buy a new top. This is the first time in 9 months he had mentioned that. He also mentioned that the timing belt pulleys that he ordered 6 months ago were not Hill Engineering as I had asked, but OEM Ferrari (which are an inferior part), and cost almost twice as much as the Hill part. 

He made me sign an agreement that he is not liable for any engine damage of his causing because I am turning down the 26 hour variator replacement. He says I can not pick up the car until the check clears, but it can not stay more than a few days, so I plan to pick it up on Monday, 2/7/2023.

I installed my license plate, took pictures for State Farm insurance, and picked up the box of old parts to take home. 

# 2/6/2023 - 258 days after drop off
Picked up my car at Vlad's, they had put in a new old battery since they said mine died. Noticed they did not roll the front driver fender like they said they would, or if they rolled it they did a not very good job. 
The car had a check engine light, suspension light, and SLOW DOWN light on when I picked it up.
I drove the car to Simply Foreign and dropped it off for further diagnosis.  
Vlad unfollows me on Instagram. 

# 2/10/2023
Called Strictly Foreign, they said the timing was done incorrectly by Vlad's Autobahn, that the camshaft and crankshaft were not in time. 
He advised me that my options were to go back to Vlad's and ask them to redo it, or the better solution would be to take it to a Ferrari dealer. 
Called Vlad's from 3 different phone numbers, no response. Voice mail is shut off. 
Called the Orlando Ferrari dealer, they couldn't get me in until March. 
Tampa Ferrari dealer sent me a quote for transport ($600 each way) and could get me in on 2/17. 
Palm Beach Ferrari said they could get me in on 2/13 or 2/14, and could comp the tow and would definitely get this fixed, and was apologetic over Vlad's Autobahn giving me the runaround.
Decided on using Ferrari Palm Beach.  

# 2/14/2023
Dropped off car at Ferrari Palm Beach. $340/hr for labor. They will also install the new fuel pumps (my left one was leaking)

# 2/17/2023
Ferrari Palm Beach said they will have an update for me next week and that the timing job was done incorrectly. 

# 3/1/2023
Ferrari Palm Beach said my car is ready and timing is fixed - they said the previous shop had either not replaced the timing belts or put in used parts. The previous shop had the timing 6 degrees off. Total is $5228 to fix the work that Vlad's did incorrectly and to install the new fuel pumps. 
State Farm said that since my car is "high mileage" at 29k, it is only worth $80k for insurance agreed value, even after they said it was worth $100k previously.  

# 3/4/2023
Picked up the car from Ferrari Palm Beach. Drove it 200 miles in the next few days, it drove perfect, no check engine lights. 
Noticed the air conditioner doesn't blow cold. 
Started a chargeback through Chase for $3800 for the timing issues and transmission hours doubling without being informed, which is illegal in Florida. . 

# 3/28/2023
The top that Vlad had "fixed" stopped working completely. Won't go up or down and is stuck in the middle. I ended up partially fixing it myself, but this is an issue that Vlad's Autobahn caused by rebuilding a hydraulic incorrectly. The hydraulic behind the passenger headrest is shooting fluid. 

# 4/28/2023
Chase approves my first charge back on the transmission/timing/timing belt issues.
