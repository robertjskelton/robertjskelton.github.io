To do an oil change on a GX470, you need the following parts and tools.

Parts:
* [M1-102A Filter](https://amzn.to/3ry6Rof)
* [6 quarts of Oil](https://amzn.to/34qMeSm)

I buy the combo kit from Advance Auto Parts, you can usually get 5 quarts of Mobil 1 and a Mobil 1 filter for ~$40, then just add another quart. I buy another 5 quart jug and just take 1 quart from it every oil change. 

Tools
* 10, 12, 14mm sockets
* [Oil Filter Removal Tool](https://amzn.to/3ssI0S2)

Drive your GX on ramps, if available. If not, you can do the whole oil change without them, just with less clearance.

To start, warm up your engine. 

Remove the 2 skid plates at the front, using 10mm and 12mm sockets. If your skid plates are ugly or rusted, you can spray paint them black, or even use [spray on truck bed liner](https://amzn.to/336KwVF). Makes it look a little better.

Grab your oil pan and put it under the drain plug. Open the oil filler cap in the engine bay, then remove the drain plug (14mm).

Let the oil drain for 30 minutes or so.

Remove the old oil filter. Touch the new oil filter to the oil one on the o-ring, so some oil comes off and lubricates the new oil filter. 

Install the new oil filter, hand tight. Install the 14mm drain plug. 

Add 6 quarts of oil. Start the GX470, let it warm up. Check the oil level. If it's low, add some a bit more. 

Reset the [Maint Light](https://rskelton.com/GX470-Reset-Maint-Reqd-Light/).

Re-install the skid plates.
