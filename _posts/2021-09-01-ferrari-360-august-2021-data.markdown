Here's my August 2021 update on Ferrari 360 prices. You can read my [original post](https://rskelton.com/ferrari-360-april-2021-data/) to see how and where I am collecting my data. This month is going to be noticeably different though - I removed the price limit. Previously, I was only tracking cars for sale for under $90k. Now, I am tracking all asking prices. There are some that are asking as high as $250k - so data will shift. This is my 5th monthly post, previous posts are:
* [April 2021](https://rskelton.com/ferrari-360-april-2021-data/)
* [May 2021](https://rskelton.com/ferrari-360-may-2021-data/)
* [June 2021](https://rskelton.com/ferrari-360-june-2021-data/)
* [July 2021](https://rskelton.com/ferrari-360-july-2021-data/)

In August 2021, I found 47 new Ferrari 360s listed for sale, with an average price of $87,040. That is a large increase in the number of vehicles - but remember, I am tracking all asking prices now, so vehicles I would have ignored before are now going to populate my datasheet. The average price also went up, but likely due to adding many 360s for sale for over $90K. I expect this data the normal out over the next few months.

Maroon is now the cheapest color! A great maroon example in Colorado just sold for a reasonable price of $68K, which brought the average price of maroon down. Every other color went up due to the price ceiling being removed. Also, a stock white 360 popped up, with a red interior! It's sweet, but the asking price is really high for a F1 transmission at $120k.

With new data, a Spider seems to sell for about $6k more than a Modena. I like both the Modena and the Spider, but I don't know which I like more still.

And here's the big kicker - almost everything over $90k has a manual transmission. These new manual examples show a $30k premium over a F1, which is about what I'd expect. It also costs $30k for a manual conversion, so if you really want a manual but can't afford it now, converting your F1 360 to a manual transmission down the road is not a bad option.

And this is the current Price vs Miles chart. A few more high mile examples sold this month.

I'll have another update at the end of September. Feel free to check out the [Ferrari 360 spreadsheet](https://rskelton.com/360) for the raw data, more charts, and links to all cars tracked. If you have any additions, corrections or advice on how to improve my pivot tables, leave a comment. 

The 360 Modena in the top picture - that would have been my pick of this month. It's the maroon over black 360 Modena that sold in Colorado for $68k. It had some great mods, like a Challenge Stradale ECU upgrade and the CS grill, and it just looked great.
