After topping up my washer fluid tank in the Suzuki Cappuccino the other week, I noticed a hole in the top of the tank. I poked the hole, and realized the whole top of my washer fluid tank was very brittle, leaking, and needed to be replaced. I ordered a [38450-80F00 Suzuki OEM Washer Fluid Tank](https://ebay.us/b9yp01) for $67 shipped from Japan, and it arrived about 2 weeks later.

To install, there are 2 large Phillips head screws on the engine side of the tank - I had to use lots of [PB Blaster](https://amzn.to/48S2uIf) to get these to loosen up.

Then you can remove the old tank. There was one clip on the passenger side of the tank I had to remove and put on the new tank.

Then you can remove the old pump, throw away the old pump gasket, and install the pump into your new tank.

While you are there, you should clean out the drain under the washer fluid tank, I poured lots of water down the drain to clean everything out.

I am getting into the habit of installing car parts before I even get the delivery notifications.

Once you have the new pump and gasket on there, re-install as before and tighten down the 2 Phillips screws, then use a funnel and add your favorite [washer fluid](https://amzn.to/45DgXoY). Done!
