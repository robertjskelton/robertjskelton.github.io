I've used a cheap air vent cell phone holder since I bought my GX470, and it's pretty annoying since it blocks 1 of my air vents. So I get hot. I live in Florida.

I wanted a phone mount that was out of the way but easy to view. [Proclip USA](https://www.proclipusa.com/product/853197-proclip-angled-mount) is a company I have used before, I had their mount in my CTS-V for years and loved it, but the GX mount did not look convenient to look at your phone while navigating. 

I decided to go with a [RAM mount](https://www.rammount.com/), with inspiration [from](https://www.facebook.com/groups/LexusGXOR/permalink/1591279391003168) [these](https://www.tacomaworld.com/threads/mod-a-pillar-ram-mount-gps-phone-holder.372250/) [posts](https://forum.ih8mud.com/threads/gx470-no-drill-phone-mount-5-minute-install.1229874/). 

It wasn't cheap, running about $70 for everything, but I'm keeping this car forever. And if I don't, it could always be moved to another GX, maybe a GX460 when I win the lottery. 

Parts Used:
* [1x RAM Ball](https://amzn.to/2QOqKrb)
* [1x M6-1.0x70mm bolts](https://amzn.to/3tGfCvg)
* [1x RAM Composite Double Socket Swivel and Ratchet Arm](https://amzn.to/2RPMOlT)
* [1x RAM X-Grip Phnoe Holder](https://amzn.to/3dF32a8)
* Random rubber spacer from my toolbox

You can get some of these parts cheaper than Amazon, like the bolts at Home Depot or Lowes.

To install it, take your RAM Ball, put a single M6 bolt through it (I did not use the M8 ones that came with my Amazon order). Put a spacer on the bolt after that, shown below.

Pop the clip off the bottom part of the grab bar on your A-pillar and remove the Phillips screw. Install your RAM ball in that spot. 

I also tried mounting this to the top position on the grab handle - I did not like the results.

Then install your RAM arm and phone holder to the ball. I actually tried using a [different RAM arm that did not rotate as much](https://amzn.to/2P8QK04), and did not like the results of that either. This picture shows the less movable arm.

So I ordered the [nicer more swivally arm](https://amzn.to/2RPMOlT) and was able to find a convenient location for my phone to sit. It has the phone at my eye level, while barely blocking any of my windsheild - you might have to expirement a while to find a good place for your uses.

Also if you're wondering what the piece of rubber that comes with the phone mount is, and how to use it, it is a [RAM X-Grip](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S8ky_uKTw98). Seems great for motorcycles or if you drive with the window down often, but the mount seems quite sturdy without it.
