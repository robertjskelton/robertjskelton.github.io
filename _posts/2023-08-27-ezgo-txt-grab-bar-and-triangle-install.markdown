We bought a 2015 EZGO TXT golf cart, and it didn't come with a safety grab bar, or low speed vehicle triangle.

Parts:
* [Grab Bar](https://amzn.to/3YSkm1e)
* [Safety Triangle](https://amzn.to/3YVUOR0)

The grab bar I installed didn't come with instructions, but basically assemble it like the product pictures, then attach to the rear bottom of the golf cart using 10mm and 14mm sockets. I had to use a rubber mallet to get the rear part set, but once in, it isn't going anywhere.

For the triangle, I drilled holes in the rear of the triangle around the grab bar metal, then zip tied it on.

Here are some other storage solutions and cool golf cart mods I plan on doing in the future:

* [Net for the Truck Bed](https://amzn.to/3srwMRA)
* [Seat Belts - required to drive on main roads](https://amzn.to/3svIrPr)
