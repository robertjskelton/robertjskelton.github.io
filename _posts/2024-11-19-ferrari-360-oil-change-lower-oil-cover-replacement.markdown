I replaced the [fuel filter](https://rskelton.com/suzuki-cappuccino-fuel-filter/) in my Cappuccino recently, and also ordered a [fuel pump](https://amzn.to/4gyzUQ1) at the same time. This is how to install it. 

First, remove your tops (and cargo net if you are lucky enough to have one). Push down the rear window.

Next, you need to remove the plastic center trim piece that sits behind the passengers. There are 4 plastic clips at the top, and 2 Phillips screws at the bottom, which are hidden by the center console. I had to remove 2 screws near the back trim on the center console, slide the back piece of the center console out by holding the switch for the back window down, then I could reach the 2 screws holding the back trim piece.

Next, you need to remove 6x 10mm bolts on the cover.

Then remove the 6x phillips screws on the top of the fuel pump. Be careful not to drop them.

Then remove the 2 fuel lines and label them, and also unclip the electrical connection. This is needed so you can wiggle the pump out.  

Now you can remove the fuel pump, make sure to have a bucket or bowl nearby to put this in. I took my fuel pump inside to replace it.

Mine was very rusted, so I cleaned it with a [wire brush](https://amzn.to/4emdqQy) and water.

There is a 3MM allen screw at the bottom holding the actual pump onto the housing, remove and save that.

Remove your old pump. Re-install the new pump with the rubber housing and fuel pump filter of your choice. Mine came with 2, I used the one that looked like it had more surface area.

For the part leading from the top of the new fuel pump to the metal line on the Cappuccino housing - I used a bit of the rubber hose that came with the new pump, cut down to size so it would fit.

Re-install is just the inverse of the install.
