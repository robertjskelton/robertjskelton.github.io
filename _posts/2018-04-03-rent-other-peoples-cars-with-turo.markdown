Update: Don't Use Turo - [here's my horror story that happened a few months later](https://rskelton.com/My-Turo-Claim-Horror-Story/). 

I recently purchased a 2016 [Corvette](https://turo.com/rentals/cars/fl/palm-bay/chevrolet-corvette/381353?s=-UnccSTA), a very nice, pretty expensive car. To help go towards the monthly payments, I listed the Corvette for rent on [Turo](https://turo.com/c/roberts974), a site where other people can rent your car with insurance. [Turo](https://turo.com/c/roberts974) is sort of like a AirBNB for cars.

The [Corvette](https://turo.com/rentals/cars/fl/palm-bay/chevrolet-corvette/381353?s=-UnccSTA)'s monthly payment is about $900/mo. $800 is the car payment and $100 is the insurance. This is the result of a ~$37,600 loan, 48 months @ 1.49% interest. That low interest rate is the only reason I even considered buying a car so expensive. I even traded in my barely running, always needing work 2005 BMW X5 4.8L on the [Corvette](https://turo.com/rentals/cars/fl/palm-bay/chevrolet-corvette/381353?s=-UnccSTA), the trade in value + tax benefits was worth more than what I paid for the BMW.

I have the [Corvette](https://turo.com/rentals/cars/fl/palm-bay/chevrolet-corvette/381353?s=-UnccSTA) listed on [Turo](https://turo.com/c/roberts974) for $200/day, of which I get to keep $150/day after their insurance, fees, and taxes are taken out. So if I rent my car 6 days a month, the whole payment is covered. I’ve rented it 2 days so far in the first month owning it, to an older man from the county South of mine so he could play a prank on his wife.

So far, I like the [Turo](https://turo.com/c/roberts974) service. I work from home, which makes it easy for me to rent my car, and I don’t need a car most of the time. I get groceries once a week, and that’s really as much as I NEED my car for. I’ll continue to have the [Corvette](https://turo.com/rentals/cars/fl/palm-bay/chevrolet-corvette/381353?s=-UnccSTA) listed on [Turo](https://turo.com/c/roberts974) and see if I can minimize my payment as much as possible while still having a nice car.

If you'd like to try [Turo](https://turo.com/c/roberts974), click on any of the links in this post and we'll both get a $25 credit. There's a [S2000](https://turo.com/rentals/cars/fl/sebastian/honda-s2000/389229?s=fBfCls8R) listed near me that I'd love to rent.
